      <description>Highlights  Reduce time to collect blog post links from hours to seconds. Received 10+ donations and 400+ endorsements.  The problem The user homepage design on Matters (a Chinese blogging platform) fits about three articles. Users&#39; content gets buried in almost no time.
Some users started to create posts that act as content pages. However, collecting blog posts by hand requires a lot of time and energy.
The solution A blog post fetcher to fetch, edit, and copy links to users&#39; posts in seconds.</description>
