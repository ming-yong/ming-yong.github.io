<content>
  <p>I went to St.Lawrence College for the <em>Computer Programmer Analyst</em> advanced diploma program in 2018. As an international student, surviving winter in Canada and surviving school became my goals in my first year.</p>
<p>School is going well after I <a href="https://mingyong.dev/blog/how-to-college/" title="How to excel in community college">figured out how the system works</a>. Now I can focus on preparing for the work placement program in our last two semesters.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to realized that GPA is not the key selling point in community college. You might think it&rsquo;s just people from all walks of life getting an education.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>However, what people are actually doing is upgrading their career path in a short three years. They did all this on top of a full-time job or a family to take care of, maybe both! Their time management skills are impressive, not to mention the work experiences they have.</p>
<p>So, what else can I bring to the table besides GPA?</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
<p>Trying to become a team lead at McDonald&rsquo;s was not an option at that time. That&rsquo;s when I started self-learning, as I mentioned in the <a href="https://mingyong.dev/journey/chapter1/" title="As a Code Newbie: What makes a good developer?">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>That part shows my <strong>willingness to learn</strong> and being a <strong>resourceful learner</strong>. My question now becomes: What other soft skill can I acquire?</p>
<p>Since my schedule doesn&rsquo;t allow me to become a team lead at McDonald&rsquo;s, I thought I would gain my <strong>mentorship</strong> and <strong>customer experience</strong> by becoming a tutor and a cashier.</p>
