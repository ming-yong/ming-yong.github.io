      <description>Setting up a custom domain According to the &amp;ldquo;configuring an apex domain&amp;rdquo; GitHub document and &amp;ldquo;Connect GitHub Pages to Your Namecheap Domain&amp;rdquo; by Paul J. Williams, there are two steps to use your custom domain for &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io:
 add 4 A records and a CNAME record on Namecheap (&amp;ldquo;Domain List&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Advanced DNS&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; Add those records under &amp;ldquo;Host Records&amp;rdquo;) add a CNAME file to your GitHub repository (you can add a file or do it through &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Options&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; Add a &amp;ldquo;Custom domain&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;GitHub Pages&amp;rdquo;)  You don&amp;rsquo;t have to purchase the SSL certificate from Namecheap or manually install one.</description>

      <title>A visit to the Tutorial Hell</title>

      <description>Like all others who try to teach themselves how to code, I once visited the famous Tutorial Hell.
It all started when I landed in the project section of freeCodeCamp&amp;rsquo;s Responsive Web Design Certification. I have completed all lessons before it, so I guess, technically, I should (at least) know how to start the project.
No, I don&amp;rsquo;t. Well, if not, I can always watch a tutorial on YouTube.
One after another, watching tutorials started feeling like talking to my dad: I keep getting an already told story/concept.</description>

      <description>Imagine you and a co-worker are in charge of tickets A and B for a new feature. Let&amp;rsquo;s say it is on the feature branch. Your co-worker completed the ticket before you do and this is how the branch looks like when you are ready to submit your PR:
In your local history, your work has the index(or SHA) of 2 but on the feature branch 2 is B.
We want to maintain a linear commit history and avoid as many merge conflicts as we can.</description>

      <title>Years in review: 2018ish to July 2020</title>

      <description>I started learning code and English in 2018 (maybe late 2017ish) to attend community college in Canada in September 2018. My learning journey so far can be divided into two phases: the &amp;ldquo;English and Code gives me headaches&amp;rdquo; phase (phase 1) and the &amp;ldquo;oh I am so lost&amp;rdquo; phase (phase 2). This post is about what I did during those phases and what I think I can improve.
Phase 1: Learn the basics If my memory serves me right, my first attempt at the first freeCodeCamp project was around January 2018.</description>
